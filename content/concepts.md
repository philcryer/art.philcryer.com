## Concepts

I think about art a lot, and have many concepts I dream up that I'd like to explore in my work. Some of these are partial works in progress, some are not.

### Guns

Too much to say right now, ask again later.

### Take only as directed

Paintings made with years of disused and expired prescriptions mixed in, with an emphasis on mental health medicines. A special thanks to television that now prescribes these medicines to us with whimsical commercials. So ask your doctor if my paintings are right for you!

### Techno is dead

Using bluetooth and NFC (near field communication) enabled beacons embedded within paintings to expand the meaning or use of a piece. It could be fun, it could also lead to other unforeseen issues. But guess what? Batteries are included!

### More things to worry about

Using potentially harmful materials; motor oil, old gasoline, plastic resins, epoxy and other potentially volatile chemicals in paintings. Once these pieces dry are they inert? Do they still require the same restrictions requiring their handling or, let's hope not, disposal? Warning: art not to be taken internally.

### Laws are boring

Archaic computing and electronics laws like ECPA, CFAA (both from 1986) are unjustly convicting the curious and ruining lives. What if I purposely infringe on these statues by putting electronic copies of copyrighted, or illegal, material in my paintings? Would this be a legal liability for myself, the artist? How about for the buyer? What if the buyer wasn't informed of the embedded data? Also, would encryption change any of those answers?
